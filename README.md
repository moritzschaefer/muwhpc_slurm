# How to use

1. Install miniconda in your $HOME
2. Clone this repository to $HOME/.config/snakemake/muwhpc_slurm
3. Make sure that $SNAKEMAKE_PROFILE is set, by adding `export SNAKEMAKE_PROFILE=muwhpc_slurm` to `~/.bashrc`

You are ready to go! Now a simple call to 'snakemake' will push your stuff to the cluster :)
